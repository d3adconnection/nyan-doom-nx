## HUD Configuration

HUD configurations are stored in the NYANHUD lump. These defaults can be changed by replacing the lump or specifying a hud config file with `-hud filename`. There are separate configurations for each game (doom, heretic, and hexen), with or without the status bar.

NYANHUD is very similar to DSDAHUD, but does include extra widgets, thus is incompatible with DSDA-Doom.

Multiple NYANHUD lumps can be stacked similar to UMAPINFO or DEHACKED. Note that the entire hud blocks will be replaced by the most recent version. This also applies to the `full` variants.

Options marked with 😸 are Nyan exclusive.

## Specification

A HUD configuration starts with the environment: `game variant`
- The `game` is `doom`, `heretic`, or `hexen`
- The `variant` options are:
  - `ex` (with status bar and extended hud on)
  - `off` (with status bar and extended hud off)
  - `full` (without status bar)*
  - `map` (on top of the automap)

> *😸 `full` variant supports 16 huds. [Learn more](#full-variant-specification)

The configuration then consists of a series of components to display: `name x y alignment [args]`
- The `name` specifies which component to display
- The `x` and `y` fields set the location of the component
  - `y` values are automatically adjusted for different font heights
- The `alignment` controls how the position is translated in different screen sizes
  - `top`
  - `top_left`
    - This alignment accounts for the size of the message area
  - `top_right`
  - 😸 `top_center`
    - component is not centered, it's anchored center
  - `bottom`
  - `bottom_left`
  - `bottom_right`
  - 😸 `bottom_center`
    - component is not centered, it's anchored center
  - `left`
  - `right`
  - 😸 `center`
    - component is not centered, it's anchored center
  - `none`
- The `args` are a series of optional parameters (see specific components for more info)
- For convenience, bottom-aligned `y` values are the distance from the bottom of the screen (`full`) or top of the status bar (`ex` and `off`)

This example configures the extended hud for doom with just the stat totals and time in the bottom left (above the status bar):
```
doom ex
stat_totals 2 8 bottom_left
composite_time 2 16 bottom_left
```

Finally, there is a positioning helper: `add_offset y alignment`
- This compensates for mixed stretching between the message font and the extended hud font
- Set `y` as the number of message font component lines at the edge of the given alignment

You can find the current default configuration [here](../prboom2/data/lumps/nyanhud.lmp).

## `Full` Variant Specification

😸 The `full` variant (without status bar) has been expanded to **16 slots**: `game full # "name"`
- The `game` is `doom`, `heretic`, or `hexen`
- The `#` is the hud number (0-16)
- The `name` (in quotes) is an optional name for the hud that shows in-game when cycling through huds
> Note that the legacy `game full` structure is still supported, it's just not possible to name the hud.

Here's an example of a `full` customisable hud:
```
doom full 5 "boom classic"
health_text 2 8 bottom_left 1
```

By default Nyan Doom comes with a NYANHUD with multiple huds *(~5 or 6 depending on game type)*. If you would like to limit the amount of default huds, you can use the command `clearhud` in the full hud defintion.

Here's an example of a `full` cleared hud:
```
doom full 2 "modern"
clearhud
```

## NYANHUD Components

Unless otherwise specified, argument values are integers. For toggles, a 1 means on and a 0 means off. For example, `stat_totals 2 8 bottom_left 1 0 1` would turn off items but keep kills and secrets enabled.
