# HeHackEd

Nyan Doom supports Hehacked patches for Heretic.

Hehacked is more complicated to support compared to Dehacked, as all patches currently use the header of `Heretic version = 10` regardless of Heretic version.

While Nyan Doom does support stacking Hehacked patches, mixing different version patches is NOT supported. (for more information, see the `HeHackEd Versioning` section below)

The following Vanilla Hehacked features are supported:
- Ammo
- Frame
- Sound
- Sprite *(via Text)*
- Text
- Thing
- Weapon

Thing blocks and REX `[STRINGS]` blocks support custom [obituaries](obituaries.md).

## HeHackEd Versioning

Nyan Doom supports Hehacked patches for Heretic `1.0`, `1.2`, and `1.3`. In order to get around the lack of version detection, Nyan Doom uses an auto-detect system to "vote" on which version a hehacked patch is most likely for. If undetected, Heretic will default to the latest (currently `1.3`).

Modders can also force a version via the `-hhever` argument to specify/override which Heretic version.
- Example: `-hhever 1.2`

Modders can also use a `HHEVER` lump to specify an exact version.
- Example: `HHEVER` text lump with the value `1.0`

>Note that Heretic Hehacked versions adjust the state and frame tables... So mixing and matching multiple Hehacked patches is NOT supported. Once a version has been selected, that version is "locked" for the rest of the loaded patches.

## DSDhacked Support

Nyan Doom supports unlimited states, frames, sprites, sounds, things via DSDhacked.
It also supports sprites named `SP##` and sounds named `DSFRE###` just like in Doom.

For more info about DSDhacked, take a look at this page here:
[DSDhacked](dsdhacked.md)

## REX (Raven Extended) Support

Nyan Doom also includes support for these Boom style REX blocks:
- `[MUSIC]`
- `[CODEPTR]`
- `[SOUNDS]`
- `[SPRITES]`
- `[STRINGS]`

## REX Strings

To add support for the REX `[STRINGS]` block, names had to be assigned to certain text strings. Many of these names were named after names given in the Heretic source code, as well as some named after ZDoom string names.

Nyan Doom supports the following string mnemonics:

## Level Name Strings
> Note that map names in heretic use the following format: "E#M#:" + 2 spaces + "map name". Heretic is hardcoded to remove the first 7 characters when displaying the map on the intermission screen.
